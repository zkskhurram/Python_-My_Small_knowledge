# 📘 1 - Headings

How to insert headings in a Markdown file?

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

Up to six headings can be used in Markdown!

# 💬 2 - Block of Words / Citation

This is a normal line in Markdown.

> This is a block of quoted text. It starts with a greater-than sign.

If we use two lines for a block of words, for the second line spacing we must enter two line breaks.

> If we want a block of text with spacing, we must put a greater-than sign at the start of each line.  
>  
> Like this.

# ↩️ 3 - Line Breaks

We can create spaces between lines in two ways: using double spaces or a backslash (`\`) at the end of a sentence.  
This is Codanics classroom — appears on the second line.

# 🔗 4 - Combine Two Things

We can combine block quotes and headings:

> ## Example Heading 2

---

# ✍️ 5 - Face of Text (Text Styles)

**Bold:** `**Bold**` → **Bold**  
*Italic:* `*Italic*` → *Italic*  
***Bold & Italic:*** `***Bold and Italic***` → ***Bold and Italic***

Alternate method using underscores:

__Bold__ → `__Bold__`  
_Italic_ → `_Italic_`  
___Bold & Italic___ → `___Bold and Italic___`

# 📝 6 - Bullet Points / Lists

We have three ways to make lists.

**1️⃣ Numeric List (auto-numbered):**
1. Day01 (Main List)
1. Day02
1. Day03
1. Day04  
   1. Day04a (Sub List)  
   2. Day04b  
      1. Day04ab (List inside Sub List)

**2️⃣ Symbol Lists (-, +, *):**

With `-` (hyphen):
- Day01
- Day02
  - Day02a
  - Day02b

With `+` (plus):
+ Day01
+ Day02
  + Day02a

With `*` (asterisk):
* Day01
* Day02
  * Day02a

# 🧩 7 - Line Breaks / Page Breaks

We can draw lines between sections using three symbols: `-`, `_`, or `*`.

Example:

This is page 1  
---  
___  
***  
This is page 2
